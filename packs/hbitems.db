Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Eye of Vecna&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Hand of Vecna&nbsp;might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Eye of Vecna&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Hand of Vecna&nbsp;each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Hand.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.</li>\n<li>Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.</li>\n<li>The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.HPvZm8YJO91k6Qdg]{Finger of Death}&nbsp;(5 charges), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.KhwiSi9fwVfUPtku]{Sleep}&nbsp;(1 charge), @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.yqUDoxk4x0NWG5Bz]{Slow}&nbsp;(2 charges), or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.L4J89JXqbKs6puEV]{Teleport}&nbsp;(3 charges).

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.</p>\n<p>Orcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Eye of Vecna&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Hand of Vecna&nbsp;might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Eye of Vecna&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Hand of Vecna&nbsp;each have the following random properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 minor beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>1 minor detrimental property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Properties of the Eye.</strong></em>&nbsp;Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have truesight.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.i3njMqHc689GvHDn]{Ring of X-ray Vision}.

Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.</p>\n<p>Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the&nbsp;Brutal Pick, the&nbsp;Earthheart Forge, the&nbsp;Anvil of Songs, and the&nbsp;Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the&nbsp;Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.</p>\n<p>Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.</p>\n<p>Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Magic Weapon.</strong></em> The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.j2ZGEwx8MhHZXds4]{Belt of Dwarvenkind}, a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.kvD4ElYCfCKpjDeg]{Dwarven Thrower}, and a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.8MNDhKb1Q87QszOJ]{Sword of Sharpness}.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties.</strong></em>&nbsp;The axe has the following randomly determined properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 minor beneficial properties</li>\n<li>1 major beneficial property</li>\n<li>2 minor detrimental properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Blessings of Moradin.</strong></em>&nbsp;If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have immunity to poison damage.</li>\n<li>The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.</li>\n<li>You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Conjure Earth Elemental.</strong></em> If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.1LkZvINag7KqBmDR]{Conjure Elemental}&nbsp;spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Travel the Depths.</strong></em>&nbsp;You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> The axe bears a curse that affects any nondwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{Greater Restoration} or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{Remove Curse}&nbsp;spell.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Axe.</strong></em>&nbsp;The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the&nbsp;Earthheart Forge, where it was created.
