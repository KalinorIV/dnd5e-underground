Other knightly orders serve a government, royal family, or are the elite military of a feudal state, such as the brutal Warlock Knights of Vaasa. Other knighthoods are secular and non-governmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer&ucirc;n who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code. Below are a few knightly organizations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Knights of the Unicorn</span></h3>\n<p>The Knights of the Unicorn began as a fad of romantically minded sons and daughters of patriar families in Baldur's Gate. On a lark, they took the unicorn goddess Lurue as their mascot and went on various adventures for fun. The reality of the dangers they faced eventually sank in, as did Lurue's tenets. Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr. The Knights of the Unicorn are chivalric adventurers who follow romantic ideals: life is to be relished and lived with laughter, quests should be taken on a dare, impossible dreams should be pursued for the sheer wonder of their completion, and everyone should be praised for their strengths and comforted in their weaknesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Knights of Myth Drannor</span></h3>\n<p>Long ago, the Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring band, and Dove Falconhand, one of the famous Seven Sisters, was one of them. The band took its name to honor the great but fallen city, just as the new Knights of Myth Drannor do today. With the city once again in ruins, Dove Falconhand decided to reform the group with the primary goal of building alliances and friendship between the civilized races of the world and goodly people in order to combat evil. The Knights of Myth Drannor once again ride the roads of the Dalelands, and they've begun to spread to the lands beyond. Their members, each accepted by Dove herself, are above all valiant and honest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Knights of the Silver Chalice</span></h3>\n<p>The Knights of the Silver Chalice was formed by edict of the demigod Siamorphe in Waterdeep a century ago. Siamorphe's ethos is the nobility's right and responsibility to rule, and the demigod is incarnated as a different noble mortal in each generation. By the decree of the Siamorphe at that time, the Knights of the Silver Chalice took it upon themselves to put a proper heir on the throne of Tethyr and reestablish order in that kingdom. Since then they have grown to be the most popular knighthood in Tethyr, a nation that has hosted many knighthoods in fealty to the crown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc5\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Knightly Regard</span></h2>\n<p>You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.</p>\n<p>Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.</p>\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc5\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Suggested Characteristics</span></h1>\n<p>Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career.

The places discussed here are all sufficiently distant from the North and the Sword Coast to justify the use of this background.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Evermeet.</em></strong> The fabled elven islands far to the west are home to elves who have never been to Faerun. They often find it a harsher place than they expected when they do make the trip. If you are an elf, Evermeet is a logical (though not mandatory) choice for your homeland.</p>\n<p>Most of those who emigrate from Evermeet are either exiles, forced out for committing some infraction of elven law, or emissaries who come to Faerun for a purpose that benefits elven culture or society.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Halruaa.</em></strong> Located on the southern edges of the Shining South, and hemmed in by mountains all around, the magocracy of Halruaa is a bizarre land to most in Faerun who know about it. Many folk have heard of the strange skyships the Halruaans sail, and a few know of the tales that even the least of their people can work magic.</p>\n<p>Halruaans usually make their journeys into Faerun for personal reasons, since their government has a strict stance against unauthorized involvement with other nations and organizations. You might have been exiled for breaking one of Halruaa's many byzantine laws, or you could be a pilgrim who seeks the shrines of the gods of magic.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Kara-Tur.</em></strong> The continent of Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faer&ucirc;n, is home to people whose customs are unfamiliar to the folk of the Sword Coast. If you come from Kara-Tur, the people of Faer&ucirc;n likely refer to you as Shou, even if that isn't your true ethnicity, because that's the blanket term they use for everyone who shares your origin.</p>\n<p>The folk of Kara-Tur occasionally travel to Faer&ucirc;n as diplomats or to forge trade relations with prosperous merchant cartels. You might have come here as part of some such delegation, then decided to stay when the mission was over.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Mulhorand.</em></strong> From the terrain to the architecture to the god-kings who rule over these lands, nearly everything about Mulhorand is a lien to someone from the Sword Coast. You likely experienced the same sort of culture shock when you left your desert home and traveled to the unfamiliar climes of northern Faer&ucirc;n. Recent events in your homeland have led to the abolition of slavery, and a corresponding increase in the traffic between Mulhorand and the distant parts of Faer&ucirc;n.</p>\n<p>Those who leave behind Mulhorand's sweltering deserts and ancient pyramids for a glimpse at a different life do so for many reasons. You might be in the North simply to see the strangeness this wet land has to offer, or because you have made too many enemies among the desert communities of your home.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sossal.</em></strong> Few have heard of your homeland, but many have questions about it upon seeing you. Humans from Sossal seem crafted from snow, with alabaster skin and white hair, and typically dressed in white.</p>\n<p>Sossal exists far to the northeast, hard up against the endless ice to the north and bounded on its other sides by hundreds of miles of the Great Glacier and the Great Ice Sea. No one from your nation makes the effort to cross such colossal barriers without a convincing reason. You must fear something truly terrible or seek something incredibly important.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Zakhara.</em></strong> As the saying goes among those in Faer&ucirc;n who know of the place, \"To get to Zakhara, go south. Then go south some more.\" Of course, you followed an equally long route when you came north from your place of birth. Though it isn't unusual for Zakharans to visit the southern extremes of Faer&ucirc;n for trading purposes, few of them stray as far from home as you have.</p>\n<p>You might be traveling to discover what wonders are to be found outside the deserts and sword-like mountains of your homeland, or perhaps you are on a pilgrimage to understand the gods that others worship, so that you might better appreciate your own deities.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The Underdark.</em></strong> Though your home is physically closer to the Sword Coast than the other locations discussed here, it is far more unnatural. You hail from one of the settlements in the Underdark, each of which has its own strange customs and laws. If you are a native of one of the great subterranean cities or settlements, you are probably a member of the race that occupies the place but you might also have grown up there after being captured and brought below when you were a child.</p>\n<p>If you are a true Underdark native, you might have come to the surface as an emissary of your people, or perhaps to escape accusations of criminal behavior (whether warranted or not). If you aren't a native, your reason for leaving \"home\" probably has something to do with getting away from a bad situation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">All Eyes on You</span></h2>\n<p>Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.</p>\n<p>You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.</p>\n<h1 id=\"toc4\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Suggested Characteristics</span></h1>\n<div class=\"feature\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n<h2 id=\"toc5\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Personality Traits</span></h2>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"width: 98.533%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">d6</th>\n<th style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">Personality Trait</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n<h2 id=\"toc6\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Ideals</span></h2>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"width: 98.533%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">d6</th>\n<th style=\"width: 90.9995%;\">Ideal</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.25609%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.9995%;\"><strong>Open.</strong> I have much to learn from the kindly folk I meet along my way.

If your background is as an agent for one of the main factions of the North and Sword Coast, here are some possibilities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">The Harpers</span></h3>\n<p>Founded more than a millennium ago, disbanded and reorganized several times, the Harpers remain a powerful, behind-the-scenes agency, which acts to thwart evil and promote fairness through knowledge, rather than brute force. Harper agents are often proficient in Investigation, enabling them to be adept at snooping and spying. They often seek aid from other Harpers, sympathetic bards and innkeepers, rangers, and the clergy of gods that are aligned with the Harpers' ideals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">The Order of the Gauntlet</span></h3>\n<p>One of the newest power groups in Faer&ucirc;n, the Order of the Gauntlet has an agenda similar to that of the Harpers. Its methods are vastly different, however: bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Order agents tend to be proficient in Religion, and frequently seek aid from law enforcement friendly to the order's ideals, and the clergy of the order's patron gods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">The Emerald Enclave</span></h3>\n<p>Maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance is the twofold goal of the Emerald Enclave. Those who serve the faction are masters of survival and living off the land. They are often proficient in Nature, and can seek assistance from woodsmen, hunters, rangers, barbarian tribes, druid circles, and priests who revere the gods of nature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">The Lords' Alliance</span></h3>\n<p>On one level, the agents of the Lords' Alliance are representatives of the cities and other governments that constitute the alliance. But, as a faction with interests and concerns that transcend local politics and geography, the Alliance has its own cadre of individuals who work on behalf of the organizations, wider agenda. Alliance agents are required to be knowledgeable in History, and can always rely on the aid of the governments that are part of the Alliance, plus other leaders and groups who uphold the Alliance's ideals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc6\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">The Zhentarim</span></h3>\n<p>In recent years, the Zhentarim have become more visible in the world at large, as the group works to improve its reputation among the common people. The faction draws employees and associates from many walks of life, setting them to tasks that serve the goals of the Black Network but aren't necessarily criminal in nature. Agents of the Black Network must often work in secret, and are frequently proficient in Deception. They seek aid from the wizards, mercenaries, merchants and priesthoods allied with the Zhentarim.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc7\"><span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Safe Haven</span></h2>\n<p>As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information.
